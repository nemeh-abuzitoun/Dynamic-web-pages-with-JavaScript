JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language.
Java provides a rich set of operators to manipulate variables. We can divide all the Java operators into the following groups 


−
•	Arithmetic Operators

•	Relational Operators

•	Bitwise Operators

•	Logical Operators

•	Assignment Operators

### Control flow
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 
For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data, but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in.
